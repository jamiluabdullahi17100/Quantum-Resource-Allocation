# DAQRAP (Decentralized Autonomous Quantum Resource Allocation Platform)

## Overview

DAQRAP is an open-source platform that enables decentralized sharing and optimization of quantum computing resources through blockchain technology. The platform creates a transparent marketplace for quantum computing time, allowing efficient allocation of these valuable resources while maintaining fairness and accessibility.

## Core Features

### Quantum Time Tokenization (QTT)
- Standardized units of quantum computing time represented as fungible tokens
- Dynamic pricing based on quantum hardware specifications and availability
- Verifiable computation proofs for executed quantum jobs

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
- Automated job scheduling and queue management
- Priority-based allocation system with fairness mechanisms
- Multi-signature validation for large resource commitments
- Dispute resolution protocols

### Quantum Resource Marketplace
- Real-time trading of quantum computing time units
- Automated market making for liquid resource exchange
- Forward contracts for future computing capacity
- Integration with major DEXs for token trading

### Hardware Integration Layer
- Universal quantum job specification format
- Adapters for major quantum hardware providers
- Automatic optimization of job distribution
- Real-time hardware status monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- Ethereum-based smart contracts (Solidity)
- IPFS for quantum job specification storage
- Zero-knowledge proofs for private job submissions
- Rust-based quantum job scheduler

### Frontend Interface
- React-based web application
- WebAssembly modules for client-side quantum circuit simulation
- Real-time marketplace visualization
- Wallet integration for token management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Rust toolchain
- Ethereum wallet
- Access to quantum computing provider API keys

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/daqrap
cd daqrap
npm install
cargo build --release
```

### Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your quantum provider API keys
3. Configure blockchain network settings
4. Set up IPFS node (optional)

## Usage

### Token Management
```javascript
// Initialize DAQRAP client
const daqrap = new DAQRAPClient({
    provider: "your-eth-provider",
    quantum_providers: ["ibm", "rigetti", "dwave"]
});

// Purchase quantum time tokens
await daqrap.purchaseQTT({
    amount: "10.0",
    maxPrice: "0.1 ETH"
});
```

### Job Submission
```javascript
// Submit quantum computing job
const job = await daqrap.submitJob({
    circuit: quantumCircuit,
    required_qubits: 5,
    max_gate_depth: 100,
    priority: "high"
});
```

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for large transactions
- Time-locked contracts for future resource allocation
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols
- Regular security audits by third parties
- Protected intellectual property in quantum algorithms
